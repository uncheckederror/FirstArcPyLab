    "I had a lot of problems with this script because of platform inconsistencies and my own mistakes. I don't understand dictionaries in python well enough to use them so instead I made a 2D list. Lots of trial and error. This script is also rather slow. To make it faster I would rewrite it so that it would perform operations of similar types like file create and geojson conversion at the same time rather than in the serial way they are done now. This is bascially an issue with the way I've conceptualize this script. I did what would have made sense for constructing these counties individually, not as a batch like I should have. "
